# Simple Calculator in C++
This program is a menu-driven calculator written in C++ that performs basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user selects an operation and specifies how many numbers (between 2 and 10) to process.

The calculator uses loops and conditional logic to handle multiple inputs, applies safe arithmetic rules (such as preventing division by zero), and displays the final result clearly. This program demonstrates fundamental C++ concepts like input/output streams, switch-case control flow, loops, and basic mathematical logic.
